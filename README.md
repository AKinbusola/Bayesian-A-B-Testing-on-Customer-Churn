# Bayesian-A/B-Testing-on-Customer-Churn

This project applies Bayesian experimental methods to evaluate the effectiveness of customer retention strategies using a real-world telecom customer dataset. The objective is to estimate whether targeted service interventions reduce customer churn among early-tenure customers, a group known to have elevated churn risk.

## Project Objective
Use Bayesian experimentation to estimate whether a retention intervention reduces customer churn among early-tenure customers.

### Intervention Definition:
